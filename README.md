# Meme-Java-GAME
I have created a java runnable game using albanian memes for fun just to practice.
 
 Meme Dungeon Survival

A high-performance, procedurally generated roguelike built in Java with a focus on smooth gameplay and meme-tier sound effects.
 The Challenge

This entire project—from the rendering engine to the procedural map generation and sound system—was built in under 24 hours. By using AI-assisted "Vibecoding," I was able to bridge the gap between initial concept and a fully playable release in a single day.

        Enemy AI that tracks and attacks the player.
